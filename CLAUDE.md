## Project Overview

GovWin IQ Customer Success Chatbot - A knowledge base and development repository for building a customer success chatbot specifically for GovWin IQ users.

## Project Structure

```
govwin-iq-chatbot/
├── config/                     # Configuration files (placeholder)
├── conversation-flows/          # Chatbot conversation flow definitions (placeholder)
├── documentation/              # Project documentation (placeholder)
├── knowledge-base/             # Knowledge base content and data
│   └── govwin-iq-knowledge-base.md  # Main knowledge base file (currently empty)
├── testing/                    # Test files and test data (placeholder)
└── README.md                   # Basic project description
```

## Current Development Status

This is an early-stage project with the basic directory structure in place but minimal implementation. All main directories (config, conversation-flows, documentation, testing) are currently empty placeholders.

## Development Approach

Since this project lacks traditional build/test commands and appears to be primarily focused on knowledge base development and chatbot configuration:

1. **Knowledge Base Development**: The primary content should be developed in `knowledge-base/govwin-iq-knowledge-base.md`
2. **Configuration Management**: Use the `config/` directory for chatbot configuration files
3. **Conversation Design**: Define conversation flows in the `conversation-flows/` directory
4. **Documentation**: Store project documentation in the `documentation/` directory
5. **Testing**: Add test scenarios and test data in the `testing/` directory

## Key Considerations

- This appears to be a documentation and configuration-heavy project rather than a traditional code repository
- No build tools, package managers, or frameworks have been identified yet
- The project structure suggests a focus on knowledge base curation and chatbot flow design
- Future development will likely involve integrating with a chatbot platform or framework

## Next Steps for Development

When working on this project, consider:
1. Populating the knowledge base with GovWin IQ-specific information
2. Defining the chatbot architecture and technology stack
3. Creating conversation flow specifications
4. Establishing testing methodologies for chatbot interactions
5. Setting up deployment and integration processes
